# error fixed by AI: 
Hello! As a senior frontend engineer, I've analyzed the error you're encountering. The TypeError: addedFaculties is not iterable happens because the addFaculties function was incorrectly assuming the API response for adding faculty members would be an array of the newly added items. It seems this specific API endpoint has a different response structure than others in the application.
To resolve this, I've implemented the following fixes:
Updated App.tsx: I've modified the addFaculties function. Instead of trying to append the API response to the local state (which caused the error), it now refetches the entire faculty list from the server after a successful addition. This is a more robust pattern, consistent with how students and subjects are handled elsewhere in the app. This change guarantees the UI always shows the most up-to-date data. I also corrected a type definition for the function parameter for better code quality.
Corrected pages/FacultyPage.tsx: I fixed some incorrect type definitions related to the onAddFaculty prop and the CSV parsing logic to ensure type safety and correctness.
These changes will fix the runtime error and improve the application's stability. Here are the updated files:
