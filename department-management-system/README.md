# Steps to upgrade node.js and npm
Thanks for the info! You're currently running:

* **Node.js:** v19.9.0 ‚ùå *(unsupported for many packages)*
* **NPM:** 9.6.3 ‚úÖ

You also have Node and NPM installed globally in `/usr/bin/`, which means they were likely installed via **apt** or a **manual installation**, not via **nvm**.

---

### ‚úÖ Goal: Upgrade to Node.js **v20** or **v22** (LTS version)

You have **two main options**. I‚Äôll walk you through the most reliable one:

---

## ‚úÖ Option 1: Use NVM (Recommended ‚Äì Safe and Flexible)

NVM (Node Version Manager) allows you to install and switch between Node versions easily **without messing with your system files**.

### üîß Step-by-Step: Install NVM and Node v20

1. **Install NVM**:
   Run this in your terminal:

   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Restart your terminal**, then confirm it's installed:

   ```bash
   command -v nvm
   ```

   It should return `nvm`.

3. **Install Node.js v20**:

   ```bash
   nvm install 20
   ```

4. **Use Node v20** for your current terminal session:

   ```bash
   nvm use 20
   ```

5. **(Optional)** Make Node v20 your default globally:

   ```bash
   nvm alias default 20
   ```

6. **Verify**:

   ```bash
   node -v   # should show v20.x.x
   npm -v    # updated version depending on Node version
   ```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Option 2: Remove System Node.js & Install LTS from NodeSource

If you **don‚Äôt want to use NVM**, you can replace your system Node.js ‚Äî but this is riskier and can break other packages.

Would you like help with this method too, or should we proceed with the safer NVM approach?
